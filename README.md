## Technical Details

### MIDI Implementation

The librarian uses System Exclusive (SysEx) messages to communicate with the M1:

```
Device Inquiry:
F0 7E 7F 06 01 F7

Device Response:
F0 7E <device ID> 06 02 mm ff ff dd dd ss ss ss ss F7
Where:
- mm: Manufacturer ID (42h = Korg)
- ff ff: Device family (M1)
- dd dd: Device member code
- ss ss ss ss: Software revision
```

### Storage

Patches are stored in the browser's local storage. You can:
- Backup all programs
- Store individual patches
- Organize by type (Programs/Combinations/Songs)
